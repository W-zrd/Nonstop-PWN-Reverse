# Introduction
![alt](/img/background2.jpg)

My write-up and notes (*Pwn & Reverse Only*) while I was preparing to compete in some national CTF events. Writing notes helps me understand better when solving challenges, so I made this repository. All of the challenges here are mostly from public open-source CTF platforms like HackTheBox, pwnable, etc.

All the challenges here are in the range of easy-medium level because I only want to learn the basics and concepts. And sincu hard-level challenges are too long to explain, i include them on my [personal blog](https://rfdhaikal-wizz.pro/#blog). Make sure you have read the [basic of assembly for CTF here](https://github.com/W-zrd/Learn-Low-Level-Assembly).
