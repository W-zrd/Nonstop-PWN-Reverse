# Introduction
![alt](background.jpeg)

My write-up and notes (*Pwn & Reverse Only*) while I was preparing to compete in some national CTF events. Writing notes helps me to understand better on solving challenges, so I made this repository. The challenges here are mostly from public open-source CTF platforms like HackTheBox, pwnable, etc.

All the challenges here are in the range of easy-medium level because I only want to learn the basics and concepts. And since hard-level challenges are too long to explain, i write them on my [personal blog](https://rfdhaikal-wizz.pro/#blog). If in any case you did'nt understand the fundamentals, make sure you have read the [basic of assembly for CTF here](https://github.com/W-zrd/Learn-Low-Level-Assembly)
