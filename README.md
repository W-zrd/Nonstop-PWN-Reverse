# Introduction
![alt](/img/background2.jpg)

My weekly write-up and notes (*Pwn & Reverse Only*) while I was preparing to compete in some national CTF events. Writing notes helps me understand better when solving challenges, so I made this repository. All of the challenges here are mostly from public open-source CTF platforms like HackTheBox, pwnable, etc. Make sure you have read the [basic of assembly for CTF here](https://github.com/W-zrd/Learn-Low-Level-Assembly).

> This repo is basically my learning progress about CTF which will be updated continuously whenever Im doing preparation and exercise for competition.
