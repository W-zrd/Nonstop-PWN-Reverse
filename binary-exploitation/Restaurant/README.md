We are given a binary challenge with libc.so.6 file. Take a look at the binary protections:

```
    Arch:       amd64-64-little
    RELRO:      Full RELRO
    Stack:      No canary found
    NX:         NX enabled
    PIE:        No PIE (0x400000)
    Stripped:   No
```

We can't execute shellcode on the stack because the NX protection is enabled. Moreover, since the author give us the libc file, i guess there is something related about finding gadgets or ret2libc. After running and doing some trial & errors on the program, there is a potential vulnerability on user input when we choose "Fill my dish" option. 

The program will print out whatever value given by the user, no matter if the user input is the correct option or not. We can use this as our entry point for doing analysis on pwndbg. What we do next is to find out the offset where the program will overflows.

Looking at the Ghidra decompiled code, the vulnerable input we talk earlier is in the `fill` function. Let's setup breakpoint on the `fill` function before it hits return instruction. To find out the offset i use built-in pwndbg pattern: `cyclic -n 8 100`. We use `-n 8` option because the architecture is 64 bit.
